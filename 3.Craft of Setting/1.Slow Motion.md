*I would like you to write what I call a slow motion moment. Write 300-700 words describing an action that takes ten seconds of real time. You may write it from either the first person (I) or the third person (he/she/it/they). No interior monologue is allowed. That means we don’t get to hear what a character is thinking (if a character is indeed present). We can only see what he or she is doing or seeing. It’s important that you stick to only about ten seconds of real time. Jump right into the description with your first line. Do not provide context or describe other events that happened before or after these ten seconds. Remember, you may not allow the character to remember past events, to wonder what is happening elsewhere, or to ruminate in any way. Basically, you are describing only the concrete, material details of the event.
Here’s a snippet of a slow motion moment, from Ian McEwan’s A Child in Time. This is a description of an awful encounter on the road with a truck:
“… He was preparing to overtake when something happened – he did not quite see what – in the region of the lorry’s wheels, a hiatus, a cloud of dust, and then something black and long snaked through a hundred feet toward him. It slapped the windscreen, clung there a moment and was whisked away before he had time to understand what it was. And then… the rear of the lorry made a complicated set of movements, a bouncing and swaying, and slewed in a wide spray of spark, bright even in sunshine. So far Stephen had had time to move his foot towards the brake, time to notice a padlock swinging on a loose flange, and ‘Wash Me Please’ scrawled in grime.’”
Some events – like car accidents – do seem to occur in slow motion. Often they are momentous. But they do not have to be as dramatic as a car crash – take for example, the first glimpse of the person you would someday marry. Here are some examples of other interesting events that take less than 10 seconds, which you could describe. Feel free to steal one of these, or make up your own!
Getting slapped
Hitting a deer with a car
Going downhill on a rollercoaster
A kiss
Pulling a trigger*

### At the airport

It has been one year since they had met. But a lot has happened over this one year. Revathi had gone to London to take care of her daughter, who had recently delivered a baby. Ranjan had stayed back in Tirunelveli, taking care of the farm and cattle. They are not tech-savvy. Though they knew how to video call, they did not do it very often and had missed each other immensely. Ranjan knew he loved Revathi very much, but he never knew how much until their separation.
Today, Ranjan was at the airport frantically looking at his watch, waiting for her arrival. The watch was an old mechanical watch that is powered by movements, a gift from Revathi almost 30 years ago. Everything lately reminded him of Revathi. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Revathi arrived pushing a huge trolley, looking very exhausted.
The moment Ranjan saw Revathi, he picked up his fragile body and tried to hurry towards her. His joints that always ached due to his intense farm labors strangely did not ache that moment. Revathi beamed and blushed. Even after 32 years of marriage, the sight of Ranjan made Revathi blush. She hurried towards him, pushing the heavy trolley as swiftly as she could and pulling her shawl closer. They met midway and smiled their broadest toothy smile at each other. 
Ranjan is so overwhelmed that tears welled up in his eyes, he felt like a teen in love. To hide his tears, he took hold of the trolley and pulled it towards him. Revathi placed her hand on Ranjan's hand and brushed it softly. The touch reminded her of the farm and cattle. She squeezed his hand, leaned on his shoulder, and said, "நான் வந்துட்டேன்" (I have come). Ranjan took a heavy breath, cleared his throat, and replied, "ஆமா,நீ வந்துட்ட" (Yup! you have come). They both smiled, walking towards the exit. Soon, they will be home.

### Character Behavior

*Go to a public place or local spot. Observe other people’s behavior, especially odd or intriguing acts. Create a character and put them in this place. Give them two traits: a behavior you observed and a negative trait about yourself. Now, write 300-600 words describing the character in the context of the place without writing anything directly about the character. In fact, write as if the character is not even present at the place during the time you’re writing it. Try to allow the reader to discover both of the character’s traits indirectly. This assignment is about implication, about leading the reader to see the character without directly describing him/her. For example, you might describe a handbag left behind, the contents of which show your character's preferences and avoidances, longings and dislikes.*

After a few hectic months at work, I was finally at the spa. It was a beautiful place with a zen vibe. Just entering the quaint and calm spa made me relax instantly. The masseuse was the best her hands were very soft. Soothing music was playing in the background. She gently kept applying lotion on my back and massaging over and over. The ambiance and the temperature of the room were perfect for a nap.When I was just about to doze off, I heard a loud chatter. In a loud voice, someone was complaining about a missing phone. Probably a customer who had missed her phone. Her loud cries almost muffled the security guard's voice. He was begging her to calm down and kept reassuring that they will look for it. 

Ignoring the security's pleadings, she barged into my room and was rummaging around muttering continuously. My head was still inside the headrest. It was so annoying to even hear her walk and talk, let alone look at her, whoever she may be. To my dismay, my masseuse stopped massaging me.
"Mam, mam, please calm down. The spa is very secure. Things don't get lost here.", said my masseuse.
"It is a brand new phone. No wonder! Someone must have taken it.", she shouted back.
"No mam, not at all. I remember very well. When you were getting massaged here, only your bag was at the table, nothing else.", replied my masseuse, politely.
"Yeah! I took it out from my bag while making payment at the counter, the bitch at the counter must have stolen it."
"No mam. I am sure someone must have kept it in the lost and found section by the reception. Please clam down and check." replied my dutiful masseuse. But before my masseuse had even replied, the woman had left stomping her foot loudly.

My masseuse took a deep breath and sighed. She put more lotion on to my back and continued massaging. I felt sorry for her. Poor thing, I wondered how many such customers she had to deal with every day.

Meanwhile, the security card was pleading her to stop yelling and share her number so that he could call and check where the phone is ringing. Shouldn't she have done this first? She yelled some more about how irresponsible the spa is and finally gave her number as if it was her idea to call and shouted the guard to call immediately.

As the phone started ringing, "Ha! it is in my bag indeed", she said bluntly and stomped her way out.

May Anne Ticao Jaro
*the author avoided writing directly about the character by simply describing her actions and showing her character through dialogue.
Does the action and/or dialogue make the characters come to life? Explain your response.*

sravya lagudu
yes

Michael Kidwell
*The action and dialogue bring out the negative traits of the character. I am curious about what else might be behind it. Is the woman late for an appointment? Is she waiting for a text from a daughter off alone at college for the first time or hoping to hear back from a first date?*

May Anne Ticao Jaro
*Indeed the action and dialogue make the character come to life. The author used the dramatic mode of characterization, i.e. introducing the character implicitly.*

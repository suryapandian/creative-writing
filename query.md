### Query Letter


Not more than one page in Times New Roman or Arial font, Keep the font size to 12 pt and the textcolor should be black

In this paragraph, share the title and genre of your book. This is also a great place to include your book’s word count.

Don’t self-deprecate, either. Starting out your query letter with a self-defeating phrase like, “I hope I’m not wasting your time,” is a big red flag to most agents. It makes the agent think, if this person doesn’t believe in his book, why should I?

Cut right to the chase. Don't waste the opening paragraph of your query letter introducing yourself. Save that for later. Much like a book, you want to hook that agent with your first sentence. The best way to do that is to introduce the hook of your manuscript right away.

Explain why you've chosen to query this specific agent. *When salespeople go out to make a sale, they attempt to learn everything they can about a client before making their pitch. The more you know, the more likely you are to target the right person and find success. When pitching to an agent, it's important you know a little bit about that agent—namely, what other books they represent. In your query, be sure to mention one or two of these books and briefly explain why you think your book is a good fit in that group.* (NOTE: If your book isn't similar in genre or scope to others the agent represents, you're likely pitching to the wrong agent.)

Few best examples,

I am currently seeking representation for my YA poems, Breeze by the Beach. Given your interest in YA poems, I thought it might be a good fit for your list.

Add your bio, but make sure it’s relevant to writing. Impress your agent with writing awards and credibility (you attend a yearly conference), or related writing experience. Keep it short (no more than two sentences).

Remember with a query letter, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel.

Do mention that your book has been reviewed by a professional editor.


*When Writing a Query Letter Don’t …*
Be arrogant. Never say anything in your query like "my manuscript is a bestseller in the making" or "you'd be lucky to represent my book." (You laugh, but some people do this.) Save all bragging until the end, and even then it should be focused on meaningful writing credits and authoritative credentials (the final "don't" on the list covers this).

*Include your age.* There is no real upside to this. In fact, it often can create unintentional bias and make it more difficult for you to sell your book.

*Tell agents that you value their time.* I learned this from my agent, Tina Wexler. Many writers waste a sentence or two in their query explaining that they know how busy the agent is and that they value their time. There's no need for this, as agents are well aware of how busy they are. More important, though, is that this is wasted space in your query that could be used to give more information about (and sell the idea of) your manuscript.

*Include writing credits that aren't meaningful.* Unless you've had books published through a publishing house before or have had work appear in something prestigious, like The New Yorker, it's best to not say anything. Just stick to selling your story and your concept. Now, if you have other non-writing credentials that are valuable—such as you're writing a nonfiction book on financial planning and you've spent 15 years working as a financial planner at a major financial firm—you want to mention that. Anything that makes you an authority on your topic is worth noting.
